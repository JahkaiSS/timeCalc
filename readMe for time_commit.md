# make a time calculator for a school course, based on "Duration" and "Time commitment"

# d = duration
# tc = time_commitment
# total_time = an array of size 2 to give a range of times
# LOGIC: total_time[0] = duration * time_commitment[0]
# and the second one is obvious

# function params = duration, time_commitment1, time_commitment2

## components: 
# 1. time function(3 params)
# 2. return total time
